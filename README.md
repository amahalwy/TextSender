TextSender is an SMS messaging application initially built for a client to send surveys to a comma-separated list of numbers.

## How to use:

- Create a Twilio account [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio). Free/hobby options exist!
- Create an API key that will also generate with a secret; copy these down **before** closing your page, otherwise you'll have to create a new API key.
- Simply paste in your Accound SID, API Key and Secret into the input fields to search for numbers associated with your account.
- Follow through the input prompts to send your first messages!

## Upcoming Features

- Displaying *failed* messages rather than a counter for user to easily locate the failing numbers.
- Make the numbers' cards show easier for the user; currently, sending 100 messages (for example) will result in a large amount of scrolling to see them all.
- History of numbers messaged; if a user is sending a text daily to the same 100 numbers, would be convenient to group the numbers and select the group with a button click.
